Clicking on the Browse Files button will launch a file explorer and will allow you to choose a directory. After a directory is chosen, you may then type in the new name for your file in the box below. After entering a new name, you will be prompted with a confirmation screen which will outline what your new file name will look like.

The format for the new file will be, "*new file name*_#.txt" with your new file name followed by an underscore and the number of the file.

For example, a directory can contain files named, "apple.txt", "banana.txt", and "orange.txt". After the files are renamed to "Mango" through the GUI,
the files will be named, "Mango_1.txt", "Mango_2.txt", "Mango_3.txt".
